Answers to exercises G1--G3:

G1.1. 
The command recursively checks every directory in the root directory and outputs any line found in any file with "smutex" mentioned it.

G1.2.
sthread.cpp:void smutex_init(smutex_t *mutex)
sthread.cpp:void smutex_destroy(smutex_t *mutex)
sthread.cpp:void smutex_lock(smutex_t *mutex)
sthread.cpp:void smutex_unlock(smutex_t *mutex)
sthread.cpp:void scond_signal(scond_t *cond, smutex_t *mutex __attribute__((unused)))

G2.1

grep "Task" RequestGenerator.cpp

G2.2

grep "return" *.h

G3

It returns all lines that are function declorations with "smutex" in the name.
sthread.h:void smutex_init(smutex_t *mutex);
sthread.h:void smutex_destroy(smutex_t *mutex);
sthread.h:void smutex_lock(smutex_t *mutex);
sthread.h:void smutex_unlock(smutex_t *mutex);

Extra credit exercise(s) (describe what you coded):
    for exercise 8 I wrote a bit of extra code in buyAllItems that will cause threads to wait in case there a change in item discount or price so that the whole order could be bought.
    didnt do exercise 9 because I cant figure out how to lock all store discount and shipping requets while an order is processing.
